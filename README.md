# RestWizard
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mclarke47/RestWizard.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mclarke47/RestWizard)

Still very much in progress.

## Introduction

### The need
The basic need: Documentation of your REST API without the hassle of keeping separate documents up to date. 

### The goal
To build an unintrusive componenet which can be added to a dropwizard application to automatically generate API documentation.

### Principles 

Must be:

* Completely unintrusive to the resource Java classes (no extra annotations, no exceptions!!).
* Easy to integrate with. One command in the dropwizard app class. The end.
